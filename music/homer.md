# Homer: The Iliad and The Odyssey
## A musical translation of the original poems

These poems were written around 800 BC, in ancient greece. Homer may have been one or many men. The meter used throughout the text is known as dactylic hexameter, essentially 6 beats. 

This video is an example of how it may have been recited. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI0mkt6Z3I0

Music in the background, and the bard following a 6 + 2 rhythym. With the 2 beats of pause to allow for breathing room. Granted, we do not know what musical theory the ancient greeks followed, but this seems to make sense. 

## English Translation
These peoms have been translated in so many different languages. Richard Lattimore's 1951 translation is widely regarded to be the most faithful in preserving the original meter. The original's musical qualities are not preserved.

Emily Wilson's more modern work has translated it into iambic pentamter. This makes it feel more like the literary English one my read in Shakespeare. WHo of course wrote plays.

No English translation can perfectly capture the quantitative meter of ancient Greek. English is stress-based rather than quantity-based in its prosody. This fundamental difference is what causes the rift between the ancient text and any of its English translations.

## A Modern interpretation
The Iliad was a performed piece, with a specific musical rhytmic backing. It is meant to be heard, not read. Imagine a room full of people listening to the bard recite the epic poem. Getting excited during battles, divine interventions, stories of pride, anger, death. The crowd would have heard these stories before, they would be hyped to hear them again, maybe this time from a different bard. A recitation of the Iliad in ancient greece may have actually looked something like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ubSwbyd0uI)

The Iliad and the Odyssey are 2800 year old poems, sitting there, begging to be interpreted in such a way that preserves the original perfomative aspect. An English script must be made, lyrics to this 15 hour hip hop song. 

## Commerical Viability

## ToDo:
- Read Lattimore's translation for the historical context. 
- Work with LLMs to translate the ancient greek into musical english
- Synthesize both versions into musical lyrics
- Write beats for the different moods of the story

A simple demo of book 1 could be made as a proof of concept.
