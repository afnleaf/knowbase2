Unnamed Song 1:
```
I've loved and I've lost
Throw me away, with the water
I don't care about the cost

Climbing up the rocks
Show me the way, to the slaughter
I don't care if I fall

Captor of the sun
Hide yourself away
Looking for someone
To stop the rain today
I don't know what's mine
Drop the line and I'll make you pay in Time
```
needs more verse but nothing has come out of me yet

Unnamed Song 2:
```
I fell down
Straight into your arms baby
I fell down
From way up there
Oh I fell down
Couldn't even care

This is them coming
Chasin' you down
This is the fight of your life
Hope you survive till the morning
See the sunrise
I don't know how, I'll break you 
Out of this life/lie/light (interchangeable)

I fell down
Not a bone broke but my heart
I fell to the ground
Yet I haven't seen your face
Still I fell down
From way up there

This is the story about a boy named Steve
Couldn't make it to market before it closes at three
Cookies and coffee and milk and tea
I don't know why but this is my place to be

This is them coming
Chasin' me down
This is the fight of my life
Hope I survive till the morning
See the sunrise
I don't know how, I'll break
Out of this life/lie/light

I fell down
I fell to the ground
I fell down
I fell to the ground
I fell down
I fell to the ground

whacky version of bridge to be sung:
This is the story about a rabbit named Steve
Couldn't make it to market before it closes at three
Cookies and coffee and carrots and celery
I don't know why but this is my place to be
```
