# Stargate failure
Calling it a failure before it has even begun is a bold take. However I will outline the clear red flags.

Looking at the [annoucement](https://openai.com/index/announcing-the-stargate-project/).

```
Initial equity funders in Stargate are SoftBank, OpenAI, Oracle, and MGX
```
These are the key players, plus a few others.

## SoftBank
WeWork - https://www.reuters.com/business/softbanks-wework-once-most-valuable-us-startup-succumbs-bankruptcy-2023-11-07/
Failed investment in a startup that cost $11.5 Billion.

## ClosedAI (OpenAI)
S(c)am (s)Altman is a grifter.

ClosedAI has no moat, we can refer to the Deepseek-R1 release. The tech is no fully open source and free for all to work on and use. To run this model fully locally and not share your data, you could buy ~22 Mac Minis ($18000). This is in the realm of owning a car, while still a lot, it is a much more democratic path of the intelligence explosion. It will only get cheaper. Many people are running distilled versions of the model on their phones, laptops or gaming gpus. We have reached a point where half the planet has access to a model that is better than original ChatGPT-3.5 (late 2022), at a tiny fraction of the compute cost.

Deepseek has proved that you don't need billions in GPUs, training time or inference for frontier, state of the art, models. Their paid API is 20-50x cheaper depending on the task. These facts are what is fueling the current tech selloff of late January 2025. 

A week after R1, Deepseek drop a SOTA any-to-any 7B parameter multimodal model. OpenAI is cooked, the only play they have left is a hail mary toss towards some mystical AGI/ASI. 

## Oracle

Early career and Oracle
Larry Ellison lecturing at the Oracle OpenWorld, San Francisco 2010
1977â€“1994
During the 1970s, after a brief stint at Amdahl Corporation, Ellison began working for Ampex Corporation. His first project included a database for the CIA, code-named "Oracle".[18][19] Ellison was inspired by a paper written by Edgar F. Codd on relational database systems called "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks".[20] In 1977, he founded Software Development Laboratories (SDL) with two partners and an investment of $2,000; $1,200 of the money was his.

## MGX
Who even is this? Saudis?

## Trump
This guy is grifter supreme. Captain Grifterica.

## Novideo (Nvidia)

What used to be a company that makes graphics cards for video games, is now primarily an AI chip company that effectively has a monopoly on the market. Deepseek shows that you need less compute to train LLMs so there is a dip in the market. However, their position is fairly unshakable, because as long as AI keeps getting better and more people use it, you will need chips. They may start moving from data center back to local compute, where jsut like you have household staples like a fridge, washing machine, car, etc, they sell you a server that you can use to run your own local LLMs. A potential declouding could be interesting, but this still undermines the rest of technofeudalist capital. The frontier models will still need to be trained on large clusters, the compute will just be used more efficiently now.
