use <prompt> to explore this idea with me

problem:
lot of people post academic papers on the internet
almost always pdf format made for desktop reading
impossible to read on mobile

solution:
use a visual LLM to convert pdf papers into readable markdown/html/pdf 
mobile friendly
easily shareable
pdf in -> preferred file out
readable in browser, downloadable
