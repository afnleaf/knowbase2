# alternative public square

there have been many social media websites over the years
- 4chan used to be fun but then you grow up
- Reddit lacks the sauce, I just don't get the point of using it
- facebook, boomers, ai slop
- twitter, fun way to post, bot filled site
- instagram, just picture slop, now reels
- tik tok, just video slop
- linkedin, business slop
- pinterest, actually seems decent but has no cultural sauce
- youtube, slop but actually a solid platform

the algorithm trends to slop after user growth is saturated, then the point becomes to keep users. the fun is done

we want to synthesize the bad from the good

### problems
slop algorithms

bots, non human interactions

corporations

AI

right wing misinformation

### solutions
one human, one account

verify the humans

proof of personhood

idena

not blockchain

keep the bots out

humans in, genuine interactions

community notes

dunce status if too much misinformation proved

users can go after each other

anonymous if you wish with content/thread specific id

human proof id hidden but required to use
