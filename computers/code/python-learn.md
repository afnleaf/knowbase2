# learning python
[reference](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/)

data in -> function -> data out

you take some type of data, you manipulate it some way, you get the output

## how python works
this is about as low level as we will go

there is an interpreter that is running to turn your code into machine code that the CPU runs

python is dynamically typed, which means you don't have to give labels to your variables like in other languages

so under the hood, the interpreter has to figure out what type your data is

this makes python slower but very easy to write

you are learning it because of how easy it is to write

there are libraries you can use that call fast code

## representing data
- variables
- lists
- dictionaries
- tuples

## control flow
- conditional operators, comparison, boolean
- if/else/elif, switch
- loops, while, for, range, break, continue
- functions
- modules

## environment
- python interpreter
- pip/packages
- virtual environment

## data parsing
how to read data into data structures inside your program

## data displaying
how to display your results

## libraries
- matplotlib
- pandas
- numpy

## notebooks
notebooks are a shortcut to do all of this, you can prototype and experiment with data very easily. However they have limitations and will not teach you proper programming and data foundations (imo)
