In quantum mechanics, ψ (psi) represents a wave function that describes a quantum state. In our strategic analysis, we're borrowing this concept to describe how a team or strategy can exist in multiple "states" simultaneously until it's actually used (similar to quantum superposition).

ψ (psi) represents the total strategic states
