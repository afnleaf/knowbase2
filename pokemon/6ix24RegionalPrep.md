Switches happen before moves

Illusion ability copies the last pokemon you bring.

In VGC you bring 4 pokemon, 2 lead, 2 bench

I want to do well at regional in Toronto. We have a month to prepare.

Last year we brought a weezing team, which is inherently a reactive disruptive force to opponents strategies. We used ability shield Tornadus under neutralizing gas to set up the field in a proactive way where we are entirely in control. I want to further explore this proactive aspect of controlling the lines of play no matter the situation.

Right now, I like bridge, maus and rain (Archaludon, Maushold, Pelipper)

Here are some iterations of teams we made using this core of 3:

Bridge v2

Dragon Teapot

Dual win conditon mixed attacker archaludon offense:
- stamina + pop bomb
- soak + electro shot
The idea of yin to the yang.
We discovered our jung, Rillaboom using the ideas detailed below.

```
Archaludon @ Magnet  
Ability: Stamina  
Level: 50  
Tera Type: Electric  
EVs: 84 HP / 252 SpA / 172 Spe  
Modest Nature  
IVs: 0 Atk  
- Dragon Pulse  
- Electro Shot  
- Body Press  
- Protect  

Maushold @ Safety Goggles  
Ability: Friend Guard  
Level: 50  
Tera Type: Ghost  
EVs: 212 HP / 4 Atk / 36 Def / 4 SpD / 252 Spe  
Jolly Nature  
- Population Bomb  
- Taunt  
- Follow Me  
- Protect  

Pelipper @ Focus Sash  
Ability: Drizzle  
Level: 50  
Tera Type: Grass  
EVs: 4 HP / 252 SpA / 252 Spe  
Timid Nature  
IVs: 0 Atk  
- Hurricane  
- Weather Ball  
- Tailwind  
- Soak  

Rillaboom @ Assault Vest  
Ability: Grassy Surge  
Level: 50  
Tera Type: Poison  
EVs: 132 HP / 116 Atk / 20 Def / 140 SpD / 100 Spe  
Adamant Nature  
- Wood Hammer  
- Grassy Glide  
- U-turn  
- Fake Out  
```

## Set optimization:
Do I make bridge bulkier or keep special attack? Flash cannon or Dragon Pulse
Rillaboom, bullet seed, loaded dice? (stamina proc)
Maushold, encore vs taunt
Pelipper, tailwind or protect

## Dual Offensive Toolkit

### Yin (Mode 1): Body Press + Stamina + Population Bomb 
- Archaludon + Maushold
- Physical-focused (Population Bomb → Body Press)
- Physically-focused while immune to intimidate
- Physically Defensive

Weaknesses:
- Population Bomb accuracy (90%)
- Ghost-types block Body Press

### Yang (Mode 2): Drizzle + Soak + Electro Shot 
- Pelipper + Archaludon
- Special-focused (Rain → Electro Shot)

Weaknesses:
- Ground types before Soak
- Tera type overrides type change to water

#### Both modes:
- Build-up strategy where boosts are
- Immediate pressure
- Uses two Pokemon's actions
- Can be disrupted by Protect
- Require similar action economy
- Scaling beyond the initial turn
- Rely on abilities (stamina and drizzle)

#### Complementary
The strength of one mode complements the weaknesses of the other and vice versa.
Soak allows you to hit ghost types with body press. 
Body press lets you hit ground types and electric resists.

## Yin to Yang to Jung
That secret spice, a dash of acid that completes the strategy.
Dialectical nature of our current modes to find the synthesizing "jung" element that creates perfect adaptability. What makes a bench position powerful in VGC?

The Jung needs to be something that:

- Work FROM THE BENCH
- Threat of switching in
- Forces team preview decisions
- Creates uncertainty in turn 1
- Allows mid-game pivots

- Forces impossible choices in game and team preview
- Force opponent to prep for all modes
- Must force PREPARATION SPLITS

- Not disrupt core pairs
- Enhance both modes
- Must work with BOTH cores
- Bridges both modes
- Must enable MODE SWITCHING

- Creates unique pressure
- Create third angle of pressure
- Must threaten DIFFERENT angles

### Theoretical Yapping
Dualistic Dialectics: Thesis, Antithesis, Synthesis (OR)
vs
Double Dialectics: Thesis, Alternative, Homeostasis (AND)

Yi, Ya, Ju

Jung is not mode 3 but rather Yi * Ju or Ya + Ju. A scalar rather than an addition.

Not sure this checks out, but worth exploring this idea.
Yi = 1 / Ya
Ya = 1 / Yi
Yi = 1 / 1 / Yi 

### Self proc stamina pivot move sequence
Archaludon is resitant to all 3 pivot moves, u-turn, flip turn and volt switch. We can avoid enemy protect but still pivot our team out and get an advantage with good field conditions. Fake out allows for Tailwind set ups on 

Flip Turn
- in rain, does more damage
- our Archaludon is currently built for damage and speed, not bulk
- every bit of chip counts
- u-turn is not stab and lower bp

Volt Switch
- ground is immune
- overlap with electro shot
- soak synergy
- STAB leads to more chip on Arch

U-turn
- lowest bp, good and bad, less chip, less damage on enemy
- probably the best option

Sequence:
- Start: Pelipper + U-turn user in front
- (Optional): Fake Out to Secure Tailwind
- Switch Pelipper → Archaludon + U-turn targeting Pelipper's slot
- Switches resolve first: Archaludon now in Pelipper's position
- U-turn executes: Hits Archaludon, triggering Stamina
- U-turn user switches out after

This creates perfect sequencing:
+ Get Tailwind up
+ Archaludon Free Stamina proc (+1 Def)
+ Get to switch U-turn user to back position
+ Works regardless of U-turn user's speed
+ Drizzle Rain established
+ Opponent forced to respect multiple modes and can't prevent the sequence
+ Forces opponent to guess intent and make reads
+ If (Rillaboom) -> Grassy Terrain established

This tech creates new dimensional pressure:
- Opponent must respect:
   - Fake Out + aggressive play
   - U-turn + switch sequence
   - Direct Attack pressure from pivot user. 
- Supporting both modes efficiently
- Maintains positioning advantage
- Adds additional mind game layer, forcing opponent to respect multiple lines
- Adding technical setup options
- Maintain control of field conditions by swapping out. (Pressure of coming back in if opponent uses their own terrain or weather)

### Spread Moves
Consider spread move pressure that:
- Hits both opponents
- Creates different positioning challenge
- Forces protect decisions
- Works with both modes
- Spread moves that proc Archaludon stamina

1. Strategic Pressure Created:
- Forces both opponents to consider Protect
- Can trigger Stamina on Archaludon while hitting opponent
- Creates speed tier relevance
- Forces targeting decisions

2. Mode Integration Requirements:
Mode 1 (Physical):
- Spread move should support Body Press scaling
- Should help control ghost types

Mode 2 (Special):
- Support Electro Shot setups
- Enable clean Soak targets
- Could work in rain

3. Optimal Spread Move Properties:
- Speed control element
- Defensive scaling support
- Coverage value
- Economic action usage

However, current team requires:
- Vs Ghost coverage
- Rain synergy
- Technical flexibility

### Jung Winner Rillaboom
Too good not to have as rilla enables both modes

1. Perfect U-turn Technical Execution:
- Enables guaranteed Stamina proc sequence
- Maintains positional advantage
- Creates multiple follow-up threats

2. Terrain Control:
- Grassy Terrain helps with ground weakness
- Provides healing support
- Creates additional positioning element

3. Versatile Pressure:
- Fake Out support for both modes
- Strong STAB Wood Hammer pressure
- U-turn pivot flexibility

4. Mode Integration:
- Supports Mode 1 through Fake Out + physical pressure
- Supports Mode 2 through terrain control and positioning
- Creates new angles through U-turn tech

The U-turn stamina proc sequence represents a perfect synthesis:
1. Lead Pelipper + Rillaboom
2. Switch Pelipper → Archaludon
3. Rillaboom U-turns Archaludon slot
4. Results in:
   - +1 Defense Archaludon
   - Established rain
   - Grassy Terrain support
   - Flexible follow-up options

This synthesis transcends the original modes while supporting them both, creating the true jung element needed to complete the team's strategic framework.

Recommend focusing on keeping Archaludon's special attack investment while using Rillaboom's U-turn tech to gain defensive boosts when needed. This maintains offensive pressure while adding defensive scaling through technical play.
