I want to do well at regional. 

I like mouse, bridge and rain

dual win conditon of bridge:
- stamina + pop bomb
- soak + electro shot

do I make bridge bulkier or keep special attack?

Bridge vs 2

#### Mode 1: Body Press + Stamina + Population Bomb 

Weaknesses:
- Population Bomb accuracy (90%)
- Ghost-types block Body Press
- Clear Body/Full Metal Body users
- Relies on two Pokemon's actions

#### Mode 2: Soak + Electro Shot
Weaknesses:
- Requires two turns (Soak then Electro Shot)
- Uses two Pokemon's actions
- Soak can miss
- Ground types before Soak

#### Both modes:
- Use two Pokemon
- Have accuracy concerns
- Can be disrupted by Protect
- Require similar action economy
- Scaling beyond the initial turn

#### Key Difference:
Mode 1: Offers scaling potential after initial damage
Mode 2: Type coverage advantage (hits Ghost after Soak)
