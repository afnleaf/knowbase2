# learning python

data in -> function -> data out

you take some type of data, you manipulate it some way, you get the output


## representing data
- variables
- lists
- dictionaries
- tuples

## control flow
- if/else/elif, switch
- loops

## environment
- python interpreter
- pip/packages
- virtual environment

## data parsing
how to read data into data structures inside your program

## data displaying
how to display your results

## libraries
- matplotlib
- pandas
- numpy

## notebooks
notebooks are a shortcut to do all of this, you can prototype and experiment with data very easily. However they have limitations and will not teach you proper programming and data foundations (imo)
