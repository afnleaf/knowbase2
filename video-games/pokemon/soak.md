# The Soak Experiment

*Professor Turo's Lab, Paldea*


Miraidon is the restricted pokemon we wish to build around.

Urivaled power due to the hadro engine effect + electric terrain.

Let the electricty flow through you.

- Deals 0.5× to Grass, Electric, Dragon
- Deals 0× to Ground

We must solve for these.

An immunity is a problem.

Ice / Electric coverage is a complementary pairing as old as time.

- Strong vs Water which enables Steel, Fire, Water, Ice
- Strong vs Flying which enables Ground, Fighting, Bug, Grass

Miraidon gets fairy coverage for Dragon types or Draco Meteor

### Regulation G Metagame

The current most popular set for Miraidon is CHoice Specs and going for slow powerful pivot with Modest or Timid for speed.

```

In his report Luca states that Miraidon must be paired with priority blocking abilities to prevent momentum loss from fake out pokemon. 

In a way, choice specs loses momentum because it collapses the state of the board to your own detriment. In exchange for power.

I wish to push the meta further and use non standard items.

I want the power of specs without the drawbacks.

```
- Choice Specs provides maximum power at the cost of move flexibility
- Armor Tail/Fake Out protection is required to maintain momentum

State Collapse Problem:
- Locking into moves creates predictability
- Loss of tactical flexibility
- Forces suboptimal plays when situation changes
- Cannot switch moves to adapt to field changes

- Miraidon wants maximum power (Choice Specs)
- BUT also wants flexibility (move choice)
- AND needs protection from priority
- WHILE maintaining speed control
```

The system cannot prove its own consistency within these constraints.

Potential Alternative Items:
- Life Orb: 30% power boost without choice lock
- Expert Belt: 20% on super effective moves
- Booster Energy: Stats + flexibility

```
Current Solutions:
Farigiraf (Armor Tail) [Used]
Safety Goggles [Available]
Mental Herb [Available]

Alternative Solutions:
Quick Guard
Follow Me without item lock
Counter-priority strategies
```

- If Miraidon can maintain 80-90% of Choice Specs power
- While gaining move flexibility
- And solving priority protection
- Then the system becomes more complete

This is where I come into play and re-oarganize the puzzle pieces. Dialectial analysis.

Farigaraf is cool but what if we got to use a stronger pokemon?

Covert Cloak blocks fake out, the main move we care about.

We want to reapproach the entire team building process, but are still fleshing out our own yin yang jung intrinity for miraidon. Considering how Luca started with Miraidon + Giraffe.

There is a way to return the power of specs via a team slot. Helping Hand. This is a 1.5 boost like specs was. However there is a move stronger than helping hand. Electro Drift does 1.333 damage when hitting super effectively. Soak allows us to turn pokemon into water types. We do more damage than specs. This is countered by Tera but we pin the opponent and force one of their most valuable resources. Or it forces a switch. It lasts longer than helping hand.

Soak makes the move do so much more damage than specs.

The problem is that we now need to use a soak pokemon and there may not be one stronger than the giraffe.

Options:
Pelipper Scarf
Tatsugiri Scarf (DozoGiri)
Inteleon Timid
Basculegion Scarf
Dondozo Unaware wall over fissure
Araquanid Wide guard
Samurott Hisui Scarf
Floatzel Jolly

We want something with more stats than giraffe that enables a mode. There are two serious options here.

Tatsugiri scarf soak into volt switch swap in dondozo. Excellent in close team sheet.

Scarf Pelipper, gives us weather control, an element of board control that could be stronger than armor tail with the right teammates like Urshifu Rapid Strike who is the strongest non restricted pokemon.

Maybe inteleon as some sort of fast screens soak setter with water/ice coverage or speed control with icy wind

Scarf adaptabilitty Basculegion.
