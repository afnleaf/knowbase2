# A Dialectical analysis of team based shooters in 2025
I was going to write a bunch about how team based shooters are doing but I don't really care right now. (2025 01)

We have the following games:
- Overwatch
- Marvel Rivals
- Deadlock (moba)

We have dialectics:
- (thesis + antithesis) --> synthesis
- (thesis <--> antithesis) <--> homestasis
Basically you have an idea (thesis) and roughly how that idea is wrong or some contradictions (antithesis). No idea will ever be without faults. You combine both to iterate and end up with a synthesis. 

The marvel universe intuitively fits the hero shooter genre. However, Marvel Rivals does nothing to meaningfully iterate or improve on the faults of Overwatch.

Overwatch essentially invented the hero shooter, it succesfully synthesized the concept of class based shooters (TF2) and heroes. TF2 already has some character elements, but overwatch takes it to the max with the hero fantasy. Overwatch heroes, are there to save the day and yell out some voiceline when they ult, just like an anime character or comic book superhero.

TF2 is sort of a middleground between a hero shooter like OW and a pure class based shooter like Battlefield or SW:Battlefront. In those games there is no identity to the character you are playing, you are the nameless soldier. Unless, of course, you get enough points to run around the map as Darth Vader. TF2 takes the concepts of assault, support, medic, recon, etc, and turns them into individual characters with real personalities. They embody the archetype they represent. They are not heroes and the game does nothing to represent them as such. TF2 characters are caricatures of the roles they represent.

You can argue if TF2 or OW is better, but I don't care. They are fairly different games and if you can't see how, then I'm sorry that you are a brainlet.

Overwatch gave us Genji, nobody in gaming had ever seen anything like Genji. A sword ninja in a first person shooter? What is going on? Genji alone is how you can say there is meaningful iteration from TF2 to Overwatch. He is not just ninja man with sword and super japanese, he is Genji. The cybernetic ninja, who died fighting his brother and was brought back to life. He has morals and a purpose in life. He tells us about his training with the Shambali. He has forgiven his brother, and is now the master of his own fate.

Marvel Rivals has over 50 years worth of lore to their universe. They are heroes, everyone knows them as heroes. We have seen the Avengers films, we have read the comics. There is no issue there. The issue that MR had to solve, was the gameplay. So, its a 3rd person shooter, ahd is probably better off for it. Everything else feels like a shallow mechanic tacked on last minute. Map destruction? I would rather have maps that are designed better. Team-ups, ok, but not that deep of system. Overwatch had these evolve, organically through actual gameplay synergy and not forced stat bonuses or extra abilities. MR feels more like a replication of the thesis rather than a synthesis. I could talk for hours about the issues Overwatch contains but so could everyone else.

From my perspective the core problem in OW is the sustain, this has not been addressed since Moth meta in September 2017. Dive was perfect, so perfect. Winston, DVa, Tracer, Genji, Zen, Lucio. The 3 tank ana nade meta before that also had sustain issues. The core problem with every "bad" meta has been sustain. I loved playing Goats (3 tank - 3 supp) but at that point we had accepted that OW was going to be like that. Sustain isn't just healing, its the overall ability of a character to stay in a single position via combined resources. Shields, immortality fields, ults, damage mitigation, resurrection, etc.

I fail to see how Marvel Rivals challenges this dynamic in any capacity. 

ToDo:
Genji/Tracer are what made Overwatch, itself. It got lost somewhere on its journey.

Deadlock is a proper synthesis of the hero shooter genre and mobas.
