# The State of Battlefield Games in 2024

I want to talk about how modern battlefield games feel to play in the current year. Not how they were on release.

If you buy battlefield games on release, you should get your head checked out because how are you getting fooled by EA?

These games always go on sale for $10 or less around two to three years after they were released. I own Battlefield 3, 4, 1, V and 2042. I think I paid less than half the launch price altogether. 

That's actually how I got introduced to the genre. Somehow EA was giving Battlefield 3 out for free in 2014. I was in high school had just built my first PC. This was the first FPS game I played consistently on PC.

I became a scout player and sniper enjoyer. So my entire perspective is biased around that. These are the best multiplayer sniping games. COD maps are too short and quickscoping is gimmicky. Overwatch widowmaker is stupid bullshit that doesn't belong in the game. CS AWP also shouldn't be in the game. Hitscan one shot shit is just ridiculous and will never be balanced on arena style maps. Battlefield has the map size that allows you to fulfill a real sniper playstyle that makes sense. Your job is to play long range as a scout that gets information for the team. The bullet drop is the icing on the cake that balances snipers out at long range and makes them oh so satisfying to use. This is the only multiplayer game where you can get 500m+ headshots. There is no comparable feeling. M98B got me hooked. 

So understand my perspective, I know I am biased.


## Battlefield 3
I got this game on steam sale cause I lost access to the account I used to have it on. It does not hold up for one simple reason. You can't adjust the ADS sensitivity for guns. I am a simple man, and use 70% ads zoom for everything.

Game is fantastic otherwise, graphics hold up. Feels the same. 

Not a lot of people are playing but there's always at least one conquest server going and one 24/7 Noshahr Canals TDM. That's really all you need.

S tier.

## Battlefield 4
Never played this until recently. 

Felt ok but really janky. Movement is all off


## Battlefield 1
This is going to be my most controversial take, this game is without a shadow of a doubt. Mega overrated.

I understand why this game is beloved for the community. But they are superficial shallow reasons to enjoy a GAME that you PLAY.

This game gets everything right about the atmosphere of world war 1.

But I don't want to "play" a ww1 sim, I want to play battlefield. 

The visibility on some maps is atrocious, I feel like half the maps are operation metro levels of donkey dick. So much fog and smoke, which granted, is an atmosphere that is cool and feels real. BUT it feels absolutely shit to play. That forest map is so ass

Feels extremely map dependent. A lot of them are atrocious and a few are extremely good. Blimp, Castle and Mountain specifically are always fun because there are no visibility issues.

I will put more hours into this game to try and learn to love it.

I have learned to enjoy it, but I still feel like a lot of the maps suck. You really need to immerse yourself in the setting to enjoy it. That is how it was intended, and I understand how it works for people. BFV is still the better game.

## Battlefield V
The worst launch. But currently the best game in the series. 

The data shows that this is the currently the most played battlefield game. People buy it on super sale for like $5 and enjoy it. 

The strength of vehicles can be frustrating but this is true for every battlefield game. In reality, WW2 tanks and planes were actually even more crazy OP. 

The smoke actually feels balanced in this mode. Visibility is not a problem, I can pinpoint people across the map with no scope.

Excellent colours that allow for visibility. There are some ass maps but they are nowhere near the level of ass as BF1 bad maps.

So many good snipers to use with meaningful attachments and progression. It feels like the took all the mistakes of previous battlfield games and fixed them. Maybe wasn't good on launch but again, what kind of idiot is playing these games on launch?


## Battlefield 2042
Is this a mobile game? This shit is straight dogshit.

Need to put more hours in but I just don't get why you would play this is BFVexists.
