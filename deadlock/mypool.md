#### best
**Abrams**
**Mo&Krill**

#### decent at
**Dynamo**
**Pocket**
**Paradox**
**Shiv**
**Mirage**

Who fills the third slot best?

Pocket would be the most fun as a pseudo frontliner

I enjoy making space with a cycle of in and out

**Abrams**
- charge in, dive out
- dive in, charge out
- ult cycles

**Mo&Krill**
- burrow in, dive out
- dive in, burrow out
- ult catch

**Pocket**
- dive in, cloak out
- invis in, cloak out
- cloak in, dive out/warp out
