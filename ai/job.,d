I think the first project would be just the aim vector stuff. No minimap in that yet, separate component. How to get funding for any of this? I need job, I can program. I made an auto streamer that auto spectates the game using simple computer vision opencv, ancient tech in AI terms.

Research Path
University labs working on game AI
Companies like DeepMind (they do lot of game-based AI research)
Could start with publishing your auto-spectator work


Independent Development
Start building the aim vector project
Document progress/share on GitHub
Could lead to opportunities or collaborations

My combination of skills is actually quite valuable:
