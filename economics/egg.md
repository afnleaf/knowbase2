# Egg Index
I care about the price of eggs, not if some CEO can afford another boat.

two sets of data

egg:
- the average price of eggs
- median income
try to find the portion of someone's income that is spent on eggs

inverse it to reveal contradiction:
- average price of a new luxury good (ex boat)
- average CEO pay (of top company)

If the CEOs are paying less relative to their income for boats than regular people are on eggs (throughout an entire year). Then something is incredibly wrong with the current system.

Now, rather than looking at pure CEO average, we want to look at the CEOs who are in the top 0.1%. The CEOs who over 50% of the american workers work for. The big corporations, the publically traded ones, Walmart, Apple, Google, United Healthcare, etc. We want the oligarchs who will have Trump's ear, the ones flying into Mar-a-lago. There will be a lot of normal ceos who run normal businesses and they will bring the average down. 

## Where to find data
Everything can most likely be found as a CSV

### Egg Prices
- USDA ERS (Economic Research Service): tracks food prices
- BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics) CPI: average retail food and energy prices dataset
- FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data): Series ID APU0000708111 for "Eggs, Grade A, Large (Cost per Dozen)"

### CEO Compensation
- SEC Filings: Form DEF 14A, EDGAR database, legal requirement to dicslose executive compensation

### Aggregated Sources
- EPI (Economic Policy Institute): tracks CEO-to-worker compensation ratio
- AFL-CIO Executive paywatch database
- S&P ExecuComp database (paid)

### Median Income
- Census Bureau historical income tables
- Social Security admin wage stats
- BLS employement and earnings reports

### Factors to consider
- how many dozens of eggs bought in a year
- CEO bonuses and other forms of compensation that don't get reported
