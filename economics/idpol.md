# identity politics: a failure
Liberal identity politics, which we will refer to as idpol is massive failure. 

Social justice warriors, like sheep, herded around by the capitalist. All they care about is endlessly speaking truth to power in their little pen. They will drag you down to their level.

Some of the ideas are good, social justice is good. Anti-rascism, super important. People should have a right to exist. 

The problem was how it is harnessed. intersectionality, while claiming to be a force for solidarity, does quite the opposite, divides you across lines in the sand. The result has been in many ways a more racialized and divided society.

Because liberal identity politics is rooted in neo-liberalism, it falls apart the second it is not profitable anymore. All of the rainbow capitalists that spent the last decade pink washing have bent the knee to Trump and Maga. All they care about is money.

For far too long, the left has been divided by these failures (by design). The left has not been able to organize in such a way to be a real anti-fascist option. They care too much about words that hurt feelings like ~~redacted~~, there I said it. Move on.

idpol takes the synthesis of class and indentity and reduces it just to indentity. 

For social justice to really be brought about, it requires a stronger foundation. Class Conciousness. This concept serves as a core unifying principle. The social justice that rises out of this will be strong and united to benefit the common human. The material conditions must be solved. You must poor the concrete for a new foundation before you can address social issues. The new foundation will intrinsically solve a lot of social problems.
