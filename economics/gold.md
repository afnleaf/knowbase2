## Bretton Woods System

- US Dollar, backed by gold
- World economy, dollarized
- Fixed exchange rates
- Stability

It all collapses in 1971, and then Nixon decides to decouple the dollar from its physical material backing.

## Money out of thin air
The money that appears in your bank account comes from nowhere in this world. It is essentially like if the banks just wrote down a number in your bank account when they give you a loan.

This money is backed by the future. They are stealing from the future and putting it in the present. They do not understand time, they think they can keep playing this game. It works until 2008.
