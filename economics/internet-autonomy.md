# Death of Liberalism via Platform Internet

Liberalism is roughly about individual autonomy. This concept has been eroded in an ironic twist of fate by the very technology that was said to free us.

Back in the day, when you went on the internet, it was an empty google search bar, with maybe some of your search terms saved. Maybe you had some bookmarks to websites you frequent. You made the decision of what website to visit. That website could be a forum, a flash game site, a place to download music, etc. On that website, there would be content, made by other people, it was sorted in some organic way, deliberatly by the people who made the website. Maybe you could sort it by some metric like date, or number of views. There was autonomy in this process. You had to make the search through the web yourself, going from link to link, looking for the content you want. Exploring.

Nowadays, the internet is 5 websites (aka apps) owned by 3 dudes. All of them are some type of platform. Where you the user, are fed an algorithmic content feed, called the "for you" page. The "algorithm" has taken all autonomy away from you. You scroll, searching for a thumbnail or headline that catches your eye. You are forced to trawl through the mud. All the while the metrics tick away, up go the views, up goes the engagement, you are generating value whether you like it or not. There is no more autonomy in the activity. You can still try your best to use the internet the old way, it still exists somewhere out there, if you know your way. But its not the same, and the majority of the platform internet era users don't know any better.

There is no more autonomy in the information you choose to consume. What was once a bastion of free expression is now the most powerful tool of behavior modification that the world has ever seen.

These platforms are owned by Kings. You the user are the Serf. Potentially a Lord if you have a sizeable following and create content yourself.
