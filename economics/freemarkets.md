# Free Markets Must Evolve
Free markets are good way to allocate resources.

Free markets are not running at peak efficiency under the current neo liberal capitalist system. 

They run even worse under libertarianism, eg Argentina. 54% of the population under poverty line. People are travelling to Chile to buy their basic needs.

Idea: A socialist system allows for the freest markets possible.

### Super TLDR
If we try full on socialism for like 20% of the economy, specifically innefficient inelastic basic needs markets. We can have freer markets across the board for everything else. 

### TLDR
Markets are powerful tools for resource allocation, but their effectiveness depends on genuine voluntary participation - something impossible when basic survival is at stake. The traditional capitalist framework, by commodifying basic needs (food, housing, healthcare), creates inherent market distortions through survival pressure, making truly "free" markets impossible. Paradoxically, a socialist foundation of decommodified basic needs and democratic economic control would enable markets to function more freely and efficiently than under capitalism. This isn't about central planning, but rather about creating the minimal sufficient structure for maximum economic freedom. By eliminating survival coercion, establishing enterprise democracy, and ensuring market transparency, we can create markets where decisions are truly voluntary, information flows freely, and innovation is driven by genuine interest rather than desperation. This synthesis preserves the efficiency of markets while eliminating their coercive elements, offering a path beyond both anarchist chaos and authoritarian control.

## Long Did Read

Markets for inelastic goods, intrinsically cannot be free. This is currently a theory but might as well be an axiom based on historical analysis. Look at the state of all the markets used to allocate the resources found in the bottom rungs of Maslow's hierarchy of basic needs.

- Food/Water
- Shelter (Housing)
- Healthcare

All completely fucked, probably the 3 biggest fuck ups of capitalism. These things are causing the most economic anxiety for everyone.

This is not an argument for full central planning.

Decommodification of basic needs will lead to commodity markets that are more free than they are under capitalism. The elimination of the coersive element of employment will allow for labour markets to run so much more efficiently. Same goes for everything else that is a commodity.

Capitalism relies on everyone to be stressed and anxious about their basic survival so that they can hire people for less money. Very simple. This is just profit motive again.


## New axioms
Classical economic theory purposefully sets the concepts of a free market and socialism as mutually exclusive. This impedes their evolution as ideas, leading to a limited system that is unable to resolve for real life events that have developed over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries.

```
if market_freedom = f(voluntary_participation, information_symmetry, competition):
    voluntary_participation = inverse_function(survival_pressure)
    information_symmetry = f(democratic_control)
    competition = f(barrier_to_entry)
```

The concept we want to maximize for is freedom. Traditionally capitalism wants to leave the free markets up to the invisible hand, ie, an absence of intervention, commonly reffered to as laissez faire. The ideas in this text postulate that freedom refers to maximized voluntary participation, where the use of intervention to reduce coercion increases net freedom.

- Decommodification of basic needs reduces survival pressure.
- Lack of survival pressure leads to more freely made decisions.
- Democratic control of the means of production reduces monopolistic tendencies.
- Reduced coercion in the entire system.

```
Total_Market_Coercion = Explicit_Regulation + Implicit_Survival_Pressure
Socialist_Markets minimize(Total_Market_Coercion)
while Capitalist_Markets only minimize(Explicit_Regulation)
```

The greatest myth of capitalism is that it maximizes for freedom, but it does not. Only vague concepts of freedom. In capitalism you are free to die. Well crafted rules actually allow for more freedom, anarchism is not freedom, its just silly.

```
Market_Freedom_Index = Σ(voluntary_transactions) / Σ(total_transactions)
Where:
voluntary_transaction = transaction where both parties have viable alternatives
```

```
Freedom_Index = Viable_Alternatives * Information_Quality * Decision_Time
where:
    Viable_Alternatives > survival_minimum
    Information_Quality = f(transparency, accuracy)
    Decision_Time = time_to_evaluate_options
```

- Basic needs markets entangle with labor markets
- Decommodification in one sector affects all entangled sectors


## Minimally Sufficient Structure
The pareto optimal point of freedom and economic outcomes.

Structure enables freedom
- simple rules create predictable frameworks
- measurable outcomes allow for optimization
- basic guarantees enable voluntary participation

Excessive control restricts freedom
- over-regulation creates rigidity
- central planning cannot overcome inefficiency
- bureaucracy stifles innovation

Good rules are:
- simple, easy to understand
- universally applicable
- foundational, support the structure, not restrict it
- measurable, outcomes can easily be evaluated for their effectiveness

A functional system has:
- predictable outcome, defined behavior that can be expected
- adaptable frameworks/rules
- resilience built in
- efficiency

```
Freedom_Function = f(structure) where:
    f(0) = Undefined [Anarchism]
    f(∞) = 0 [Totalitarianism]
    argmax(f) = Optimal_Structure
```

Let's transcend the current axioms by examining the fundamental incompleteness in our market rule framework and expand it.


## System Analysis

1. Current Axiom Limitations
```
Current_Framework = {
    Basic_Needs_Rule,
    Enterprise_Democracy_Rule,
    Market_Information_Rule,
    Resource_Rule,
    Anti_Monopoly_Rule
}

Unprovable_Statements = {
    Innovation_Generation,
    Cultural_Evolution,
    Value_Creation,
    Knowledge_Formation
}
```

2. Framework Expansion:

A. Innovation Axiom
```
Old: Innovation = f(market_incentives)
New: Innovation = f(market_incentives, cultural_freedom, knowledge_access)
Expansion: Add knowledge commons rule
```

B. Value Creation Axiom
```
Old: Value = market_price
New: Value = market_price + social_utility + ecological_impact
Expansion: Add value measurement framework
```

C. Cultural Evolution
```
Old: Culture = external_to_system
New: Culture = f(economic_relations)
Expansion: Add cultural feedback mechanisms
```

3. New Rule Emergences:

1. Knowledge Commons Rule
```
Rule: Knowledge must be openly accessible
Implementation:
- Public research funding
- Open source requirements
- Patent reform
- Educational access
Effect: Accelerates innovation
```

2. Value Measurement Rule
```
Rule: Multi-dimensional value tracking
Implementation:
- Social impact metrics
- Ecological footprint

- Knowledge generation
Effect: Better resource allocation
```

3. Cultural Development Rule
```
Rule: Economic systems must support cultural flourishing
Implementation:
- Arts funding
- Community spaces
- Creative commons
- Cultural preservation
Effect: Enriches society
```

4. System Completeness Analysis:
```
for each (rule in Extended_Framework):
    if generates_unprovable_statement(rule):
        add_new_axiom()
        verify_consistency()
        measure_completeness()
```

Key Insights:
1. Market rules need cultural dimension
2. Value creation transcends price
3. Knowledge commons enable innovation
4. Cultural feedback shapes markets

The expanded system shows:
- Markets are culturally embedded
- Innovation requires openness
- Value is multi-dimensional
- Knowledge is foundational


### Historical Analysis:

1. Failed Synthesis Attempts
- Third Way Politics (1990s)
  * Claimed to bridge capitalism/socialism
  * Actually: Neoliberalism with welfare characteristics
  * Result: Increased inequality, maintained coercion
```
Third_Way = Capitalism + Minimal_Welfare
Reality = Enhanced_Capital_Power
```

2. Fascist Economic "Synthesis" (1920s-40s)
- Why It Attracted Support:
  * Promised to solve class conflict
  * Claimed to transcend left/right
  * Offered economic security
- Why It Failed:
  * Maintained coercive hierarchies
  * Required external enemies
  * Relied on constant expansion
```
Fascist_Economics = {
    Aesthetic: Class_Collaboration
    Reality: Enhanced_Exploitation
    Requirement: Perpetual_Conflict
}
```

3. New Synthesis Framework:

A. Bridge Points Between Left/Right:
```
Shared_Values = {
    Economic_Freedom: True
    Individual_Choice: True
    Market_Efficiency: True
    Innovation_Drive: True
}
```

B. Reframe Contradictions:
```
Old_Dichotomy: State vs Market
New_Framework: Structured_Freedom
Where:
    Freedom = f(Basic_Security)
    Markets = f(Clear_Rules)
    Innovation = f(Reduced_Coercion)
```

4. Key Synthesis Elements:

A. For the Right:
- Markets remain primary allocation mechanism
- Individual choice preserved
- Innovation and entrepreneurship enhanced
- Reduced bureaucracy
- Clear, simple rules

B. For the Left:
- Basic needs guaranteed
- Democratic workplace control
- Environmental protection
- Reduced exploitation
- Economic security

C. Synthesis Points:
```
Freedom = Security + Opportunity
Markets = Rules + Voluntary_Exchange
Democracy = Economic + Political
```

5. Why This Avoids Fascism:
- No scapegoating required
- Based on expanding freedom
- Reduces hierarchy
- Embraces diversity
- Measurable outcomes
```
Fascist_Trap_Avoidance = {
    External_Enemy: Not_Required
    Racial_Hierarchy: Eliminated
    Class_Conflict: Resolved_Through_Democracy
    Economic_Security: Universal
}
```

6. Implementation Path:
```
Phase_1: Basic_Needs_Guarantee
Phase_2: Enterprise_Democratization
Phase_3: Market_Information_Systems
Phase_4: Environmental_Integration
```

Key Principles:
1. Freedom requires foundation
2. Markets need structure
3. Democracy includes economy
4. Security enables innovation
5. Rules enable freedom

This synthesis:
- Preserves market efficiency
- Eliminates survival coercion
- Maintains individual choice
- Enables true innovation
- Creates measurable outcomes

## Examples

"Feudalism provides the food serfs eat."

"Colonialism is necessary, the monarchy is good for everyone."

"You're alwayus gonna have chattel slavery, it's human nature."

Capitalist engages in:
- job cuts
- mergers and aquisitions of small business competitors (monopolization)
- increase prices, lower wages, blame "inflation", meanwhile profit go up (60% of americans live paycheck to paycheck)

under the current capitalist system the owners own and control the means of production (tools, machines, materials, etc) and exploit workers for their surplus labour value as profit. The workers do not own the means of production and must sell their labour power to survive.

There is no two party system in republicans and democrats, the owners own both of them. In reality there are two groups, the owners and the workers. 
The goal of the owners to remove regulations on markets, this includes:
- health and safety measures
- environmental protections
- worker's rights
- trade regulations
- anti trust laws
- price controls
- corporate taxes
- public services
- social programs

Examples of the above: (need sources)
- PFAS forever chemicals found in the blood of 87% of Americans
- Microplastics found in the blood of 77% of humans tested
- Average american consumes more than 70,000 particles of microplastics per year
- The US is the only developed country with no statuatory paid leave
- The US is the one of only six countries in the world without a national paid parental leave policy
- In December 2022, Joe Biden blocked a rail strike organized by a dozen unions representing 115,000 workers. Two months, later a train derailment caused by conditions rail workers had protested occured in East Palestine, Ohio leading to a chemical and environmental disaster.
- The rail company responsible, Norfolk Southern, is one of many corporate doners funding the construction of cop city (Georgia)
- In the last 2 years, Republicans in at least 10 states introduced or passed laws rolling back child labour protections.
- In June 2023, the supreme coutry ruling in Glacier Northwest vs International Brotherhood of Teamsters established that companies may sue workers or unions for property damage as part of a strike. This ruling serves to intimidate workers from hurting their employer's profits by withholding their labor.

Commodification of Human needs:
- Air
- Water
- Food
- Housing
- Healthcare
- Clothing
- Education
- Transit
- Land
- Energy
- Infrastructure
- Technology
- Arts
- Social Relations
- Sex
- Ideas and Knowledge

The capitalist seeks to commodify all of these basic needs. Goods and services are produced as commodities to be bought and sold on the "free" market, meaning they're produced for their exchange value rather than use value. This effectively creates, overproduction, waste, artifical scarcity, planned obsolescence and economic crises.

With labor itself taking commodity-form and state-protected private property ownership of the means of production, workers are forced to sell their labor power for survival, are alienated from the wealth they create, and are exploited for their surplus labor value exporpriated as profit.

Examples:
- 45,000 americans die each year due to lack of health insurance
- 55% of american adults have medical debt
- 1 in 5 americans have student loan debt
- there are 27 empty US properties per homeless american
- While 34 million americans are food insecure, daily US food waste amounts to 356 million meals (per year?)
- 30% of four-year college students and 40% of two-year college students experience food insecurity
- nearly 40% of all US food is wasted
- 1 in 4 US households experience energy insecurity, meaning they face challenges paying elctric bills or sustaining adequate heating or cooling their homes


Now, with the attention economy, the capitalist seeks to commodify the very essence of your being, your soul.

Imperialism to conquer the global south, eliminate their national sovereignty, self-determination and industry.

- System Inversion: Goldsmith argues that the economy has become the master, rather than the servant of society. 
- Measurement Problem: A critical flaw in using pure economic indices (GDP, GNP, etc) as primary measures of societal success. Result is the "vibecession" in 2024.
- Global Labor Arbitrage: Global labor markets disrupt the historical capital-labor compromise that enables social stability in developed nations. H1-B visa discussion of late 2024.
- Elite consencus vs Popular opinion: Ex, 30-70 split in France regarding trade agreements, elite for, people opposed
- Distinction in foreign investments: market seeking vs labor arbitrage

Predictions vs Outcomes:

Goldsmith_Prediction = {
    Wages: "going to go down much more",
    Jobs: Mass displacement to lower-wage countries,
    Labor_Power: Significant decline

    Manufacturing_Jobs: Declined ~35% since 1979,
    Union_Density: Dropped from ~20% (1983) to ~10% (2023)
}
```

Global Labor Arbitrage

Prediction: Companies would exploit global wage differentials, leading to downward pressure on developed world wages
- China's WTO entry in 2001 led to "China Shock" in US manufacturing
- Estimated 2-2.4 million US manufacturing jobs lost to China 1999-2011
- Created "race to the bottom" in labor conditions globally

}
```

Economic Indices
```
Goldsmith_Core_Thesis = {
    Problem: "Economy serving economic indices rather than society",
    Result: "Destroying stability of our societies"
}

Contemporary_Evidence = {
    GDP_Growth: Continued upward
    BUT
    Inequality: Record levels,
    Social_Mobility: Decreased,
    Life_Expectancy: Declining in US,
    Trust_in_Institutions: Historic lows
}
```

Implications for our model:
```
Market_Freedom = f(voluntary_participation)
where:
    voluntary_participation = inverse(survival_pressure)

Therefore:
    Current_System = High_Survival_Pressure → Low_Real_Freedom
    Socialist_Alternative = Low_Survival_Pressure → High_Real_Freedom
```

## Taxes
If everyone's basic needs are met we can actually decrease taxes. The main reason we have taxes is to recapture some of that stolen (it really is stolen ok?) surplus labor value generated by the workers, and reinvest it. 

- If the workers collectively own the means of production in some industries and are getting paid more.
- If the coercive forces of labor arbitrage are lifted and basic survival pressure is no longer present.

Then everyone is doing better in the economy. Everyone can more easily access basic needs and other true commodities. Some programs that require taxes now, under capitalism, could be completely eliminated.

In the current system, taxes, essentially, represent the failure of the system. Wealth is too concentrated, inequality is too high, taxes adjust these. (Also fund the government :V)

"Socialism is when the government does stuff. And it's more socialism the more stuff it does. And if it does a real lot of stuff, then it's communism." - Richard Wolff :O lol This is awesome. He knows marxism!!!!!!!

In reality socialism is none of this. Simply, it is a restructuring of the products of the economy from the hands of the few into the hands of all. It's not about equality, it's empowerement.

This is potentially a fantastic vector to target taxation is theft libertarian types who don't really understand much about actual economics and parrot fools like Thomas Sowell, Murray Rothbard, Ayn Rand, Milton Friedman, etc. I literally have taken only macro/microecon 101 and have synthesized way past their low iq takes. I'm educated in the field of computer science and software engineering for pete's sake. Why is this stuff so easy to understand, its so clear how it works. Is it dunning kruger or do I actually have a knack for non entrenched economic thinking.

These thinkers fail because they have tried to build complete economic theories with a foundation of incomplete axioms. This would be like trying to build some large scale computing system while ignoring: Error handling, Edge cases, System state, Race conditions, Network effects, Cascade failures, etc. You must approach system creation in a godelian sense, where you are willing to evolve and constantly expand your axioms. A much less rigid system can bend and break and rebuild itself effectively.

```
while(true) {
    assume_everything_works();
    ignore_edge_cases();
    pretend_no_errors();
}
```

Crazy idea but markets aren't actually just supply and demand graphs. That is kind of a bad abstraction that doesn't really teach you much honestly. Though you can use it to prove very easily why inelastic markets straight up don't work. Idk how econ profs don't realize we can use this to prove their lessons wrong in like 2 seconds.

## Nosferatu Market
This is what we will call the capitlist "free" market. Vampire Market, blood sucking leeches.

when Count Orlok says Ellen will submit to him of her own volition in 3 nights. But he's gonna kill all her friends too if she doesn't. The contradiction is so heavy handed you almost miss it.

Like nosferatu we will destroy you with sunlight foul demon of death.

## The H1-B Discourse
The contradictions are too strong and MAGA movement types are potentially starting to wake up. True populism cannot be done with right wing capitalism, there needs to be real populist sauce. That can be fascism which appeals to bad emotions or we can appeal to good jesus type feed the poor emotions.
''
"Peter Thiel is sitting in his supervillain lair, watching his computer screen in horror as Elon undoes their 10-year campaign to commandeer the American Right in a single evening."

how mad are the other billionaires who have aligned themselves with MAGA like Marc Andreesen, David Sacks at the fact that this village idiot is the richest man in the world and he is shitting himself throwing up over everyone at the party before the birthday boy (trump presidency) has even arrived. Were less than a month from inauguration and the class interests have sparked a right wing civil war. This is their first policy discussion in 8 years and they cant figure it out

Turns out you can't actually reconcile "America First" nationalism with global capitalist interests

A guy like Curtis Yarvin who they all parrot must be pretty mad rn. His ideas are getting giga exposed by this fiasco. Musk is such a cry baby, this is not over. Obviously big business will win in the end but maga is going to get angry. As the capitalist tightens their grip, some will slip through and wake up. They have been blowing so much culture war smoke up their base's asses but the wind is turning. 
This also proves how bad the democratic party is if they couldn't cause thisto happen through free exchange of ideas.

## Mangione vs UHC Case
```
Current_System_Axioms = {
    1: "Murder is wrong",
    2: "Healthcare system is legal",
    3: "System provides justice",
    4: "Jury system is impartial"
}

Unprovable_Statements = {
    1: "Healthcare deaths are not murder",
    2: "Executive decisions are not violence",
    3: "Legal system protects justice not property"
}

Process_Analysis = {
    if unprovable(murder_definition) in system(current_law):
        expand_axioms();
        redefine(violence_basis);
        integrate(systemic_violence);
}
```
System must maintain that murder is wrong (it is), but cannot explain why healthcare denials that lead to death are legal. This is a forced checkmate, there will be recognition of systemic violence. We see this because 69% of people polled say claim denials have a partial role in the CEOs death. This case is about the system's ability to maintain its own core contradictions. 

We need to strike as the cracks begin to open. The seeds must be sown now.

## Axiomatic Immutability failures
First page of macro econ 101 was about perfectly rational actors. You have to assume this for all the models to work. Ok? well, then your models are wrong lmao idk what to tell you.

Markets also clearly aren't efficient so what now. We throw all of classical econ out the window?

No we expand our axioms.

    Alternative_Options → 0 for basic needs
    Time_Pressure → ∞ for survival requirements
