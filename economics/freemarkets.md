# Free Markets Must Evolve
Free markets are good way to allocate resources.

Free markets are not running at peak efficiency under the current neo liberal capitalist system. 

They run even worse under libertarianism, eg Argentina. 54% of the population under poverty line. People are travelling to Chile to buy their basic needs.

Idea: A socialist system allows for the freest markets possible.

### TLDR
Markets are powerful tools for resource allocation, but their effectiveness depends on genuine voluntary participation - something impossible when basic survival is at stake. The traditional capitalist framework, by commodifying basic needs (food, housing, healthcare), creates inherent market distortions through survival pressure, making truly "free" markets impossible. Paradoxically, a socialist foundation of decommodified basic needs and democratic economic control would enable markets to function more freely and efficiently than under capitalism. This isn't about central planning, but rather about creating the minimal sufficient structure for maximum economic freedom. By eliminating survival coercion, establishing enterprise democracy, and ensuring market transparency, we can create markets where decisions are truly voluntary, information flows freely, and innovation is driven by genuine interest rather than desperation. This synthesis preserves the efficiency of markets while eliminating their coercive elements, offering a path beyond both anarchist chaos and authoritarian control.

## Long Did Read

Markets for inelastic goods, intrinsically cannot be free. This is currently a theory but might as well be an axiom based on historical analysis. Look at the state of all the markets used to allocate the resources found in the bottom rungs of Maslow's hierarchy of basic needs.

- Food/Water
- Shelter (Housing)
- Healthcare

All completely fucked, probably the 3 biggest fuck ups of capitalism. These things are causing the most economic anxiety for everyone.

This is not an argument for full central planning.

Decommodification of basic needs will lead to commodity markets that are more free than they are under capitalism. The elimination of the coersive element of employment will allow for labour markets to run so much more efficiently. Same goes for everything else that is a commodity.

Capitalism relies on everyone to be stressed and anxious about their basic survival so that they can hire people for less money. Very simple. This is just profit motive again.


## New axioms
Classical economic theory purposefully sets the concepts of a free market and socialism as mutually exclusive. This impedes their evolution as ideas, leading to a limited system that is unable to resolve for real life events that have developed over the course of the 20th and 21st centuries.

```
if market_freedom = f(voluntary_participation, information_symmetry, competition):
    voluntary_participation = inverse_function(survival_pressure)
    information_symmetry = f(democratic_control)
    competition = f(barrier_to_entry)
```

The concept we want to maximize for is freedom. Traditionally capitalism wants to leave the free markets up to the invisible hand, ie, an absence of intervention, commonly reffered to as laissez faire. The ideas in this text postulate that freedom refers to maximized voluntary participation, where the use of intervention to reduce coercion increases net freedom.

- Decommodification of basic needs reduces survival pressure.
- Lack of survival pressure leads to more freely made decisions.
- Democratic control of the means of production reduces monopolistic tendencies.
- Reduced coercion in the entire system.

```
Total_Market_Coercion = Explicit_Regulation + Implicit_Survival_Pressure
Socialist_Markets minimize(Total_Market_Coercion)
while Capitalist_Markets only minimize(Explicit_Regulation)
```

The greatest myth of capitalism is that it maximizes for freedom, but it does not. Only vague concepts of freedom. In capitalism you are free to die. Well crafted rules actually allow for more freedom, anarchism is not freedom, its just silly.

```
Market_Freedom_Index = Σ(voluntary_transactions) / Σ(total_transactions)
Where:
voluntary_transaction = transaction where both parties have viable alternatives
```

```
Freedom_Index = Viable_Alternatives * Information_Quality * Decision_Time
where:
    Viable_Alternatives > survival_minimum
    Information_Quality = f(transparency, accuracy)
    Decision_Time = time_to_evaluate_options
```

- Basic needs markets entangle with labor markets
- Decommodification in one sector affects all entangled sectors


## Minimally Sufficient Structure
The pareto optimal point of freedom and economic outcomes.

Structure enables freedom
- simple rules create predictable frameworks
- measurable outcomes allow for optimization
- basic guarantees enable voluntary participation

Excessive control restricts freedom
- over-regulation creates rigidity
- central planning cannot overcome inefficiency
- bureaucracy stifles innovation

Good rules are:
- simple, easy to understand
- universally applicable
- foundational, support the structure, not restrict it
- measurable, outcomes can easily be evaluated for their effectiveness

A functional system has:
- predictable outcome, defined behavior that can be expected
- adaptable frameworks/rules
- resilience built in
- efficiency

```
Freedom_Function = f(structure) where:
    f(0) = Undefined [Anarchism]
    f(∞) = 0 [Totalitarianism]
    argmax(f) = Optimal_Structure
```

    Basic_Needs_Rule,
    Enterprise_Democracy_Rule,
    Market_Information_Rule,
    Resource_Rule,
    Anti_Monopoly_Rule
}

Unprovable_Statements = {
    Innovation_Generation,
    Cultural_Evolution,

New: Value = market_price + social_utility + ecological_impact
Expansion: Add value measurement framework
```

C. Cultural Evolution
```
Old: Culture = external_to_system
New: Culture = f(economic_relations)
Expansion: Add cultural feedback mechanisms
```

3. New Rule Emergences:

4. System Completeness Analysis:
```
for each (rule in Extended_Framework):
    if generates_unprovable_statement(rule):
        add_new_axiom()
        verify_consistency()
        measure_completeness()
```

Key Insights:

3. Knowledge commons enable innovation
4. Cultural feedback shapes markets

The expanded system shows:
- Markets are culturally embedded
- Innovation requires openness

### Historical Analysis:

1. Failed Synthesis Attempts
- Third Way Politics (1990s)
  * Claimed to bridge capitalism/socialism
  * Actually: Neoliberalism with welfare characteristics
  * Result: Increased inequality, maintained coercion
```
Third_Way = Capitalism + Minimal_Welfare
Reality = Enhanced_Capital_Power
```

2. Fascist Economic "Synthesis" (1920s-40s)
- Why It Attracted Support:
  * Promised to solve class conflict
  * Claimed to transcend left/right
  * Offered economic security
- Why It Failed:
  * Maintained coercive hierarchies
  * Required external enemies
  * Relied on constant expansion
```
Fascist_Economics = {
    Aesthetic: Class_Collaboration
    Reality: Enhanced_Exploitation
    Requirement: Perpetual_Conflict
}
```

3. New Synthesis Framework:

A. Bridge Points Between Left/Right:
```
Shared_Values = {
    Economic_Freedom: True
    Individual_Choice: True
    Market_Efficiency: True
    Innovation_Drive: True
}
```

B. Reframe Contradictions:
```
Old_Dichotomy: State vs Market
New_Framework: Structured_Freedom
Where:
    Freedom = f(Basic_Security)
    Markets = f(Clear_Rules)
    Innovation = f(Reduced_Coercion)
```

4. Key Synthesis Elements:

A. For the Right:
- Markets remain primary allocation mechanism
- Individual choice preserved
- Innovation and entrepreneurship enhanced
- Reduced bureaucracy
- Clear, simple rules

B. For the Left:
- Basic needs guaranteed
- Democratic workplace control
- Environmental protection
- Reduced exploitation
- Economic security

C. Synthesis Points:
```
Freedom = Security + Opportunity
Markets = Rules + Voluntary_Exchange
Democracy = Economic + Political
```

5. Why This Avoids Fascism:
- No scapegoating required
- Based on expanding freedom
- Reduces hierarchy
- Embraces diversity
- Measurable outcomes
```
Fascist_Trap_Avoidance = {
    External_Enemy: Not_Required
    Racial_Hierarchy: Eliminated
    Class_Conflict: Resolved_Through_Democracy
    Economic_Security: Universal
}
```

6. Implementation Path:
```
Phase_1: Basic_Needs_Guarantee
Phase_2: Enterprise_Democratization
Phase_3: Market_Information_Systems
Phase_4: Environmental_Integration
```

Key Principles:
1. Freedom requires foundation
2. Markets need structure
3. Democracy includes economy
4. Security enables innovation
5. Rules enable freedom

This synthesis:
- Preserves market efficiency
- Eliminates survival coercion
