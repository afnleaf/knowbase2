There has been some discourse about immigration into the united states. Particularily around the H-1B visa stuff, people coming from india etc. 

To me, it boils to profit motive, as most things in business do, value for the shareholders yada yada. Pay immigrants less, mistreat them, essentially exploit them. They can't leave the job or else they get kicked out of the country. Textbook coercion, coconut island.

It's not about anythign else.

What's interesting is how this is fracturing the incoming administration. With Vivek longposting about how americans are bad parents or smth like that (taken in bad faith)
