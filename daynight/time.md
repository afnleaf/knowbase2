done with computer
bed computer time
done with bed computer
small rectangle computer time


do not give your children to the simulacra-beast
it will devour their mind


no phone while poop
unless at work


wash your hands


the day starts when you wake up
everything flows from that point onwards


if you wake up on the wrong side of the bed
find your way to other side and get up again
